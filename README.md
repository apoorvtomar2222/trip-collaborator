# Trip Collaborator

### About the project.
Trip Collaborator is an application which will help solve the biggest problem of booking a trip amongst friends, family and relatives.

### Problem Statement.

While we are planning for our next getaway, normally we have lots of places in our mind. These suggestion we either get it from various  platforms but managing them is a bit of a concern.

The thought behind Trip Collaborator is to make that hustle easier, two users should easily be able to share location. There are various features that can be implemented along with these.

I will add scope to which this project can be extended in scope section. If anyone interest can submit a pull request.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
